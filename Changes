1.04  Wed Jul 17 09:08:28 MEST 2002

			<aaron.duncan AT centrelink.gov.au>)

		(implemented by Adam Benjamin <aebenjam AT opentext.com>)
	- Many systems don't allow users to execute the "at" command
		so tests fail. Now you need to set environment AT_CAN_EXEC=1
		to exec all tests if you're not root. Set AT_VERBOSE=1 to
		get more info about test execution.
