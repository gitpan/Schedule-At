 Schedule::At - OS independent interface to the Unix 'at' command
 ===========================================================================

 Sometimes when you write a perl script you have to call an external command.
 That's ok if it's a private script or if you know for sure it will run on a
 single architecture.

 But if want to distribute the script or you work on a multi-architecture
 environment you can't simply call to the external command and expect it
 will work just fine. That only happens in the movies.

 This module privides an OS independent interface to the Unix 'at' command
 and it will map the calls to real (and OS dependent) commands. It has been
 configured and tested for:

		Solaris 2.6
		HPUX 10.20
		SunOs 4.1.4
		Digital Unix 3.2
		Linux (RedHat 4.1)
 
 You can configure a new OS very easyly (read the end of the At.pm module),
 and the mechanism used could be used for configuring and adapting other
 OS dependent commands. Please, feel free to send e-mail to josear@ac.upc.es
 to discuss this matter, configure Schedule::At for more Operating Systems or
 report bugs.
